# Project Background
A multinational retail organization with a workforce of over 490,000 employees sought to evaluate and enhance its overall performance management framework. The companyâ€™s HR department wanted to gain deeper insights into employee productivity, compensation effectiveness, training impact, and satisfaction levels across multiple locations and job roles.

This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes a comprehensive HR dataset containing demographic information, job details, performance ratings, compensation data and engagement metrics in order to uncover critical insights that that will improve this company's workforce productivity and organizational culture.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Performance & Productivity Analysis:** Evaluation of employee performance ratings, overtime, and productivity indices to identify high-performing individuals and departments.
- **Compensation & Satisfaction Insights:** Analysis of salary structures, bonuses, and satisfaction scores to assess whether compensation correlates with retention and engagement.
- **Attrition & Retention Trends:** Identification of departments and job levels with the highest turnover and the underlying factors influencing employee exits.
